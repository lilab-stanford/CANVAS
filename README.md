### A cross-modality AI framework for ecological habitat reconstruction from histopathology

**CANVAS** (***C**ellular **A**rchitecture and **N**eighborhood-informed **V**irtual **A**I-driven **S**patial profiling*) is a biologically grounded, cross-modality AI framework that integrates high-dimensional spatial proteomics with routine histopathology to reconstruct, quantify, and model tumor ecological habitats directly from H&E-stained tissue sections. By learning to transfer CODEX-defined cellular neighborhoods (CNs) onto native histology, CANVAS enables accurate and scalable inference of spatial habitats across whole-slide images. This cross-modality alignment is powered by vision–language foundation modeling, refined through AI-agent–guided biological interpretation, and optimized via efficient spatial feature selection and machine learning–based prognostic modeling. Spanning single-cell resolution to population-scale clinical inference, CANVAS builds a functional bridge between spatial biology and precision oncology, enabling interpretable and translatable spatial biomarker discovery.

### 🔧 Key Modules

#### (1) CN-to-habitat prediction via a vision–language foundation model

CANVAS leverages a vision–language foundation model trained on paired CODEX and H&E whole-slide images to infer CN-defined ecological habitats directly from unannotated histology. This module integrates:

- Co-register CODEX and H&E images at single-cell resolution and map CODEX-defined cellular neighborhoods onto histology
- Use cn_assignment to generate habitat labels for training and validation
- Train a vision–language model to predict habitat classes from H&E images based on the co-registered CNs
- Predict habitat classes on H&E images using the trained model

**Run:**

```bash
python cn_assignment.py
python habitat_training.py
python habitat_prediction.py
```

**Output:** Patch-level maps of predicted habitat classes across whole-slide H&E images.

#### (2) Habitat-level spatial feature generation

For each inferred habitat, CANVAS extracts a suite of biologically interpretable spatial features spanning six categories:

- **Composition:** Quantifies the relative abundance of each spatial habitat within the tissue section
- **Diversity:** Measures habitat heterogeneity using metrics such as Shannon index, Fisher’s alpha, and richness
- **Spatial dispersion:** Describes habitat spatial distribution based on Ripley’s K, L, and F functions, as well as related metrics
- **Interaction:** Quantifies pairwise spatial associations between habitats using permutation-based analysis
- **Distance:** Computes directional Euclidean distances between habitat pairs
- **Transition entropy:** Non-Euclidean metrics reflecting the internal complexity and interfacial dynamics of the spatial architecture

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript Feature_generation/Spatial_metrics.R
Python Feature_generation/Distance_calculation.py
```

**Output:** Multiscale spatial feature matrices per sample.

#### (3) Feature selection and prognostic modeling

To identify clinically meaningful spatial biomarkers, CANVAS performs:

- Bootstrap LASSO and RandomForestSRC for feature stability and importance
- Univariate Cox regression for interpretable survival association
- Multivariate modeling across cohorts for immunotherapy outcome prediction

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript Feature_selection_modeling/feature_selection_modeling.R
```

**Output:** Refined panels of spatial biomarkers and risk prediction models with translational relevance for immunotherapy.

#### (4) AI-Agent module for spatial feature interpretation

CANVAS incorporates a large language model (LLM)-driven AI agent to facilitate the systematic interpretation of high-dimensional spatial features by linking them to underlying spatial biology and relevant clinical priors.

The agent generates structured, human-interpretable outputs across five key biological dimensions:

- (i) Feature category
- (ii) Characteristic cellular composition of the associated habitat
- (iii) Description of the encoded spatial property
- (iv) Tendency for topological coupling with other habitats
- (v) Potential biological and clinical relevance

**Setup:**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"
# Optional: only if you route through a custom endpoint
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://your-custom-endpoint"
```
**Run:**

```bash
python AI_Agent/run.py
```
**Note:** Replace the default API key with your own in spatial_agent.py.
**Output:** An interpretable annotation layer that contextualizes model-derived spatial features within tissue architecture, ecological topology, and clinical significance.

### 🔬 Applications

- Immunotherapy response stratification in NSCLC and other solid tumors using spatially resolved habitat features
- Habitat-informed prognostic modeling across large-scale cohorts including TCGA, PLCO, and NLST
- Patient subtyping independent of PD-L1 expression levels or canonical oncogenic mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS)
- Virtual reconstruction of the tumor–immune ecosystem directly from routine H&E histology, enabling scalable tissue profiling without multiplex staining

### 📦 Installation and Basic Usage

We recommend using `conda` to manage environments for CANVAS.

```bash
#Please install MUSK first (required)
conda create -n canvas_env python=3.8
conda activate canvas_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

R packages used include:

```r
install.packages(c("survival", "glmnet", "randomForestSRC", "ggplot2", "vegan", "entropy", "spatstat"))
```

### Basic Usage
1. Load the model
```bash
from Habitat_prediction.api import load_model, predict_folder

model, device = load_model(
    #weights=str(WEIGHTS_PATH),    # optional: local weights only
    musk_source=MUSK_SOURCE,      # hf_hub or local path to MUSK backbone
)
print("Loaded model on:", device)
```
2. Run inference on all images under the folder
```bash
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

df = predict_folder(
    model, device, DEMO_DIR,
    img_size=384, batch_size=64,
)

OUT_DIR = Path("Demo_data"); OUT_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
out_csv = OUT_DIR / "output.csv"
df.to_csv(out_csv, index=False)
print("Saved")
```
